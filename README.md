# Amarchy

I installed Omarchy about 25 times because something kept on corrupting itself. So I took the obvious route for a developer and cleaned up the distro. Now don't kill me Ruby devs, but why does there need to be an all.sh file that gets called when you can easily just call the sh files that are in the all.sh file from the file where you called the all.sh file. I'm so drunk right now it's not even funny. So basically I cleaned up the code and got rid of the useless stuff and replaced chromium with brave, why chromium though not chrome just chromium. Ee ooh what why do we need to do that? Also just because I'm nice I made it so every hour a snapshot gets made so if you get stuck in emergency mode hell (Arch Linux moment) you can just rewind to the last hour and everything is fine woo hoo. also one more critism about the omarchy code why is the installer not it's own thing? Yes, that makes installing longer but at least downloading it and putting it on a flashdrive is easier.
